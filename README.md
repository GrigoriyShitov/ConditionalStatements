Mandatory task*. Enter the integer coordinates of the three vertices of a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. Find the coordinates of its fourth vertex. If the user enters the coordinates of points in such a way that it is impossible to obtain a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, display a corresponding message.


There are three points on the number axis: A, B, C. Determine which of the last two points (B or C) is located closer to A, and display this point and its distance from point A. If the user enters the coordinates of B and C like this, that they will be equidistant from A, coincide with A or with each other - issue a corresponding message.


Mandatory task*. Given an integer in the range 20–69 that defines age (in years). Print a line describing the specified age, ensuring that the number matches the word “year” correctly, for example: 20 - “twenty years”, 32 - “thirty-two years”, 41 - “forty-one years”. If the user enters data that does not meet the conditions of the task, an error message will be displayed.


Given an integer in the range 100–999. Print a line describing this number, for example: 256 - “two hundred fifty-six”, 814 - “eight hundred fourteen”. If the user enters data that does not meet the conditions of the task, an error message will be displayed.
